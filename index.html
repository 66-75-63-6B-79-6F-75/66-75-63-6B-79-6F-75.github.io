          Scripting Server is a Flask server specifically designed for hosting and serving Lua scripts. 
          It can be loaded using a loadstring. It can be used, for example, to host files on a website, 
          or it can be integrated into a GUI/UI. 
          The program can also be used with 'Ngrok', 
          which is a portable port forwarding tool.
